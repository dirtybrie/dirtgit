                    <p>DIRT & THE ANIMATION:</p>
                    <p>
                    Me (and the people in my head) and my better-half are the ones making this happen. Dirt is just a headline for the production and development.  InSeparable is an explicit animated comedy as its main feature. </p>
                    <p>LEGS AND ARMS:</p>
                    <p> (Brie Kish/Dirty Brie) I'm doing everything besides all of the voice acting and writing is pretty much just finding shit that me and my lover find hilarious, and very offensive.
                    Still curious about the everything?
                    I animate every frame and compose the sound engineering (sound effects, cinematics, theme song, etc.) for the whole project. The storyboard is covered up to even the smallest details. from bios to plotpoints, to punchlines and straight up
                    shit talk. By myself and Isaiah Zamora.
